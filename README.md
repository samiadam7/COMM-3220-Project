# LegendScreen Adventure Film Database Project
## Overview
This project develops a comprehensive database system for LegendScreen, a fictional film studio, to improve its performance in the Adventure film genre. The database captures detailed information about films, actors, directors, and various other entities in the film industry, with a focus on Adventure movies. It is important to note that the data is fictional; however, we have attempted to keep it as realistic as possible.

## Context

LegendScreen is a young and thriving film studio known for its active engagement in developing, financing, producing, distributing, and marketing a diverse range of films. The company has achieved success in horror, comedy, and drama genres due to its exceptional ability to source and train specialized producers. Recently, LegendScreen expanded into the Adventure genre following extensive market research that highlighted it as the most popular film genre with the largest potential market share and high average return on investment (ROI).

The database system aims to compile a variety of Adventure film information to conduct thorough analytics research and draw actionable insights. It goes beyond conventional movie databases by exploring a broader range of indicators contributing to a film's quality and memorability. The system establishes connections beyond theatrical success, delving into film penetration across various platforms and licensing arrangements, and mapping out the interconnectedness of awards with films, actors, directors, composers, and other contributors.

## Business Problem

Despite its success in other genres, LegendScreen's first three years of operations within the Adventure genre have been notably disappointing. The studio launched four Adventure films, none of which met revenue or box office expectations. Furthermore, critical reviews for each of these movies were predominantly negative, citing a lack of striking visuals and captivating cinematography as main sources of disappointment.

LegendScreen must deliver compelling Adventure films that resonate with audiences in the near future to avoid these risks. The studio aims to use the new database system to strengthen its Adventure operations by identifying trends, determining predictors of success, and understanding effective resource allocation. This data-driven approach is crucial for LegendScreen to compete effectively in the Adventure genre and reverse its current underperformance.
